Typically to remember preferences, sessions (for example to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not), or track behavior (e.g. pages visited). \n\nIf set by the website the user is visiting, it's called a first-party cookie, while a cookie set by external services the website is using is called a third-party cookie.   \n\n## Why we use cookies\n\nTo improve this website and the services provided via the website, we use cookies to analyze how our visitors use the website. \n\n## The cookies we use\n\nPlease note that we use [Google's option to anonymize the IP-address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052) of the visiting user to be as privacy friendly as possible. This means that nor Google nor us will store the only personally identifiable piece of information we could collect - i.e. your IP-address.\n\n| Type | Name | Purpose | Duration |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Preference | cookieConsent | Remember cookie agreement/disagreement | 1 year |\n| Analytics | _ga, _gat, _gid | Third party cookies from Google Analytics, used to track the usage of the website | 2years, 10 minutes, 24 hours respectively |\n\n## How to opt out?\n\nThere are several ways to avoid having cookies placed on your computer in general, and for this website in particular:\n\n### Block the use of cookies\n\nMost web browsers allow you to completely block all-, or only third-party cookies. This often results in some websites stop working properly.\n\n### Do not track (DNT)\n\nIf you enable [DNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) in your browser, it will send a do not track-request to each website you visit. The owner of a website can then choose to adhere to this request or not. In our case we do respect this request, and do not set any cookies if DNT is enabled.\n\n### Reject cookies\n\nAt your first visit to this website we'll display a banner asking for your approval (or disapproval) to use cookies. Rejecting means we will only set a cookie to remember your choice.  \n"
