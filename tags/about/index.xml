      <description>About Greentechdev is an initiative by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket) to support developers to make use of our data and services. We belive that well managed environmental data is of significant benefit and makes a difference for the environment. GreenTechDev is an explorative test platform for usability tests created by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. In this mission a source of inspiration is the site JobTechDev by the Swedish Public Emplyment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen).</description>
