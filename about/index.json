We belive that well managed environmental data is of significant benefit and makes a difference for the environment. GreenTechDev is an explorative test platform for usability tests created by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. In this mission a source of inspiration is the site [JobTechDev](https://jobtechdev.se) by the Swedish Public Emplyment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen). The purpose is to develop easy-to-use open data and services in the environmental domain. Following are the API:s and prepackaged data files that are made available in this test. Don’t hesitate to [contact]({{< ref \"support.md\" >}}) us, for things missing, suggestions and alterations!\n\n\n  **_Please note this website is currently just a proof of concept_**\n\n"
